# WIP tree-sitter-xQuery

Please note: this is very much a **work in progress**.
I am learning as I go, and may go down many dead end or wrong paths.
[Contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) and suggestions are welcome.

A tree-sitter grammar is built for an as-you-type experience in a text editor.
It should provide identification of syntax tree parts that enable
text highlighting, folding, scope info and more for a text editor.
The incremental tree-sitter parse should be a step above text highlighting with regular
expressions, but should not be confused with a validating parser. Unlike a 
validating parser, tree-sitter will not stop on-error, but continue to parse.
